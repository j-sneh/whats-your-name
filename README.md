# What's Your Name?  

**What's Your Name?** is a smart glasses application designed to assist people with face blindness by recognizing individuals and recalling past conversations.  

## How It Works  
- The system listens for introductions or detects new encounters.  
- It records the introduction and conversation while capturing an image of the person.  
- The data (image, context, and conversation details) is stored in a database.  
- Upon seeing the person again, the glasses recognize them and retrieve stored information.  
- A summary, including the person's name and past discussions, is read aloud to help maintain smooth conversations.  
- After each interaction, the database updates with new details.  

This tool aims to reduce awkward moments and enhance social interactions for individuals with face blindness.
